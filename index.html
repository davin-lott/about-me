--EXTRA CREDIT COMPLETED--
FLOATING DIV (5pts)    YES
STRIPED TABLE (5pts)   NO
MODAL PORTRAIT (10pts) NO
ARTISTIC MERIT (10pts) YES I didn't do much, but I did make it look like the haiku is on a ripped
                            piece of paper and I added a border and shadow around my picture. I 
                            probably don't deserve all 10 extra credit points, but maybe some.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS
The only thing I have to add is that I couldn't tell if the extra things were required or not. The beginning
said that the required stuff was worth 80% of our grade, but then not required things said that it was 
extra credit.

        <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
        &emsp; One of my big interests is stories. I love watching movies and TV shows, reading books, 
        and talking about those stories with others. I really love seeing how stories are put together, 
        and the tricks that the authors/creators have to make us feel certain ways or to set things up. I like
        almost all genres for stories. I'll watch anything from horror to rom-coms.
    </p>
    <p>
        &emsp; Another one of my interests is juggling. My aunt and uncle taught me the basics of juggling when I was
        almost twelve, and I pretty much taught myself from there. I have juggled eight juggling balls, performed
        a number of times, and love creating new tricks. It is also a good work out, though I have been injured by it.
    </p>
    <p>
        &emsp; The last interest I'll talk about is solving logic problems. I love the problem-solving that happens with 
        Computer Science. When I was in high school I figured out how to make my own Spot-It game, which is where
        every card in a deck has one and only one match with every other card in the deck.
